= DB Packages

This repository contains packaguing scripts for data base engine used by Apollo blockchain

Linux and Windows scripts should be run on Linux. The script dowloads official builds of MariaDB and re-packs it in the 
format tha is used by Apollo installers.

MariaDB does not provide officiall builds for MacOS, so MacOS script uses "Brew" to install MariaDB and then repacks it.


For more recent version please use "develop" branch
